Introduction:

Airbnb is a widely used platform for providing accommodation services, and ratings are a crucial factor for users to choose their accommodation. Therefore, it might be beneficial for both hosts and guests to find out how these ratings are formed. Our aim is to investigate which factors, if any, have direct influence over overall ratings of users’ accommodation experience.

In order to do so, we aim to examine factors such as neighborhood, amenities, price etc. to determine if there is a causation between these factors. In the first step, we will clean our data to dispose of corrupted values and places with low numbers of given ratings. In the aftermath, we will examine the correlations between these factors and the rating of accommodation to conduct and test our hypothesis.


Problem Definition:

It varies from individual to individual what makes a great accommodation experience for them. Since most people choose their accommodation according to the ratings, the question of which factors increase the ratings is important. Some people may look for higher ratings, but their personal preferences for certain features may not always be reflected in the rating of a particular accommodation. So, they usually look for that feature’s quality in the comments section and lose lots of time. Therefore, in this context, our project aims to assist individuals in finding accommodations that align with their specific preferences in a more efficient manner.
